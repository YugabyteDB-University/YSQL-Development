    "In the `03_Demystifying_table_sharding_tablets_and_data_distribution.ipynb` notebook, you discovered how YugabyteDB stores data in tablets. You also learned that YugabyteDB and YSQL support two sharding strategies for tables: hash and range sharding.\n",

A tablet leader has a peer group known as tablet followers, and this group of tablet peers exists as a Raft consensus group. YugabyteDB calls this distributed document store, DocDB.\n",
