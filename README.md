**OK, it started, BUT the ybu-lab terminal shows errors. What can I do???**
- There should be some helpful error messages, but in spite of that, you can run two scripts:
  - `start_all.sh` starts yugabyted and accepts 1 argument with zero or 1 value: `zone`, `region`, or `cloud`
  - `stop_and_destroy_all.sh` kills all the nodes.
- Here's how to force the fix and get things back on track in the `ybu-lab` terminal:
  - 1) `cd $GITPOD_REPO_ROOT`
  - 2) `.\stop_and_destroy_all.sh`
  - 3) `.\start_all.sh region`

**I'm still running into issues. Where can I find help and support?**
- You can ask questions our community Slack in the #training channel at [YugabyteDB Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/yugabyte-db/shared_invite/zt-xbd652e9-3tN0N7UG0eLpsace4t1d2A/).
